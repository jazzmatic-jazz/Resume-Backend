CSS

1. Design a registration form and a listing table with the following fields:
	Name,id,email address,password
	Style it like you wish using class and id 

2.  Difference between padding and margin?

3. Create a file named, "profile.css."
	Open "profile.html"
	Add a <link> to your profile.css file.
	Using a mix of HTML and CSS, consider making the following modifications:
	Align your profile image to the left.
	Force your profile image into a square shape.
	Place your name heading and your "about me" paragraph into a single <div>.
	Place this <div> right next to your profile image.
	Add left margin to your <div> to give your profile image some room.
	Remove the borders of your table leaving only a single dividing line between each entry.
	Alternate the background color of each table row using an nth-child selector
	Use the :hover pseudo-class to increase the size of each of your fears as the user mouses over them!
